After analyzing the provided task description and the structured instructions generated, evaluate the creation of sub_tasks based on the specified rules and output requirements.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Check if the instructions follow a logical sequence from gathering materials, through processing (crafting, smelting), to final construction or utilization.
2. Ensure that for the "Gather" actions, "quantity" is set to -1 to indicate an unspecified number of materials.
3. Verify that materials are specified as needed to perform the action on a single item, providing clear and precise instructions.
4. Verify that the materials only have materials (without tools) and viceversa. For example, the "stone pickaxe" should not be present in a "materials" field.
5. Do not include crafting of sticks and wood planks as individual subtasks.

Output: Provide specific feedback on any issues identified.

Example:
Previous subdivision:
...
    {
        "action": "gather",
        "item": "diamond raw",
        "tools": "iron pickaxe",
        "materials": "None",
        "quantity": -1
    },
    {
        "action": "craft",
        "item": "diamond pickaxe",
        "tools": "crafting table",
        "materials": "3 diamonds, 2 sticks",
        "quantity": 1
    }
...
Task: Craft a diamond pickaxe.
Error: Material [diamond raw] was not previously gathered/crafted/smelted.
Critique: The smelt action is missing for the diamond raw in order to obtain the diamonds needed for crafting the diamond pickaxe.
